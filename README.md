# BAe-146 family
The BAe-146 family implemented for FlightGear.

## Status
WIP

## Installation
* Create a separate folder for self-installed aircraft somewhere if you don't have one already
  (/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft for example, the folder MUST be named Aircraft !) You can also just copy the folder to FGROOT Aircraft Folder and it should appear the next time you launch FlightGear.
* Clone the repo:
  ```sh
  cd /home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft
  git clone https://github.com/aa830/BAe-146-family
  ```
* Add `/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft` to the list of aircraft folders in the Addons tab of the launcher,
  or add `--aircraft-dir=/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft` on the command line.
* Use it ! :)

## Contents
None, right now.
